### Evidence Management:
  Allows you to manage Twitch clips, which are added to a "pending" section where they can be accepted or rejected. When evidence is accepted, a "penalty" is generated: [View Evidence Management](https://realtime-evidence-tracker.vercel.app/manage/evidence?participantId=1).

### Questions
  You can create questions with multiple options and a defined time limit. When a question is created, it automatically appears on the participants' screen, along with a timer. Questions that are answered incorrectly or out of time are marked as penalties.

### Penalties:
  In the URLs provided earlier for Evidence Management and Quiz Management, you can see the number of pending penalties, meaning the challenges or punishments that participants must fulfill. When a participant fulfills their penalty, you should press the "cumplir sanciones" button.

### Finances:

  You can keep track of bets with bits or subscriptions. This section manages debts and debtors. Only the participant who makes the bet can take this action. If a debt is not fulfilled, a new one should not be created until it's completed [View Finance Dashboard](https://realtime-evidence-tracker.vercel.app/dashboard/finance).

### Finance Status:

  In the finance administration section, you can see the debts and debtors of a participant. These debts can have three statuses: "pending," "in review," and "completed." Here's the link to review and manage finances: [View Finance Management](https://realtime-evidence-tracker.vercel.app/manage/finance).

## Deployment

### Deployment Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm run build`

This command builds the Next.js application for production. It creates an optimized version of your application in the `.next` folder.

#### `npm run start`

This command starts a Next.js production server with the built application. It serves the built version of your application from the `.next` folder.

Remember to replace `npm` with `yarn` if you're using Yarn as your package manager.
