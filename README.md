  <li><h4><strong>Statistics:</strong></h4> Displays statistics for each participant, including penalties and finances. Moreover, this content can be placed in OBS, so you can show or hide the statistics of other participants and align the content as you wish. Here's the link: [Stats](link-to-stats).

  </li>
    <li><h4><strong>Evidence Management: </strong></h4> Allows you to manage Twitch clips, which are added to a "pending" section where they can be accepted or rejected. When evidence is accepted, a "penalty" is generated. Here's the link: [Evidence Management](link-to-evidence).

  </li>
    <li><h4><strong>Questions</strong></h4> You can create questions with multiple options and a defined time limit. When a question is created, it automatically appears on the participants' screen, along with a timer. Questions that are answered incorrectly or out of time are marked as penalties. Here's the link to create questions: [Quiz Dashboard](link-to-quiz-dashboard), and here's the link where participants can view and answer questions: [Quiz Management](link-to-quiz-management).

  </li>
    <li><h4><strong>Penalties:</strong></h4> In the URLs provided earlier for Evidence Management and Quiz Management, you can see the number of pending penalties, meaning the challenges or punishments that participants must fulfill. When a participant fulfills their penalty, you should press the "cumplir sanciones" button.      
  </li>
    <li><h4><strong>Finances:</strong></h4> You can keep track of bets with bits or subscriptions. This section manages debts and debtors. Only the participant who makes the bet can take this action. If a debt is not fulfilled, a new one should not be created until it's completed. Here's the link to create finances: [Finance Dashboard](link-to-finance-dashboard).
  </li>
    <li><h4><strong>Finance Status:</strong></h4> In the finance administration section, you can see the debts and debtors of a participant. These debts can have three statuses: "pending," "in review," and "completed." Here's the link to review and manage finances: [Finance Management](link-to-finance-management).
