    <li><h4><strong>Penalties:</strong></h4> In the URLs provided earlier for Evidence Management and Quiz Management, you can see the number of pending penalties, meaning the challenges or punishments that participants must fulfill. When a participant fulfills their penalty, you should press the "cumplir sanciones" button.      
  </li>
    <li><h4><strong>Finances:</strong></h4> You can keep track of bets with bits or subscriptions. This section manages debts and debtors. Only the participant who makes the bet can take this action. If a debt is not fulfilled, a new one should not be created until it's completed.
